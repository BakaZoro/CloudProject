Simulation of how Federated Computing works across Multiple Clouds

A program is run on a single cloud first and when the CPU utilisation in the VM in that cloud goes beyond a threshold value then the program simulaneoulsy starts on another VM in another Cloud. This way using cloud services provided by different cloud service providers, we make best use of the advantages and the services that different service providers have to offer.
